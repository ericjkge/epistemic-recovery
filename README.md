## Introduction

## Installation

### Data Preparation
We primarily use the [DAPO-Math-17k](https://huggingface.co/datasets/BytedTsinghua-SIA/DAPO-Math-17k) dataset for training. You can download it by running:
```bash
bash experiments/math/prepare_dapo_data.sh
```

The dataset for Section 6.2 (*"Relationship Between Task Coverage and Learning Performance"*) and the evaluation datasets are available in the `/data/math` directory.

### Prompt Reformatting
The DAPO-Math-17k dataset prompts the model to produce answers in the `Answer:` format. The following script reformats these prompts to elicit `\boxed{}` answers instead. We found that this reformatting consistently improved the model's accuracy.
```bash
python experiments/math/change_math_prompts.py
```

**Before:**
```python
[{'content': 'Solve the following math problem step by step. The last line of your response should be of the form Answer: $Answer (without quotes) where $Answer is the answer to the problem.\n\nIn triangle $ABC$, $\\sin \\angle A = \\frac{4}{5}$ and $\\angle A < 90^\\circ$. Let $D$ be a point outside triangle $ABC$ such that $\\angle BAD = \\angle DAC$ and $\\angle BDC = 90^\\circ$. Suppose that $AD = 1$ and that $\\frac{BD}{CD} = \\frac{3}{2}$. If $AB + AC$ can be expressed in the form $\\frac{a\\sqrt{b}}{c}$ where $a, b, c$ are pairwise relatively prime integers, find $a + b + c$.\n\nRemember to put your answer on its own line after "Answer:".', 'role': 'user'}]
